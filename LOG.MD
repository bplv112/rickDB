# Day 0 - Jan 5, 2022

	Just had to try this because I was getting lazier by the day.

	Today's Progress : Started a repo and decided what I want to code on for the next 100days. It's reactJS. YAY! Updated node, created a react app and found a fun project to work on.

	Thoughts: Really starting to get excited about coding again. This happened after a long time and I hope I can continue on this for the next 100 days.
